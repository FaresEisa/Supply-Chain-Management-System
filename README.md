The sql queries need to be executed in a specific order, otherwise it wont recognise the primary keys.

the c# code will work after executing most of the sql queries, as the code needs to find the database tables to stores data, you will need to change any connection string in the c# code so it finds the database

if you manage to run the program, the functionalities that works are: Register (any user), Login (owner and sellers).-- the buyer and logistic login still not implemented as it takes ages to merge the buyer data to the existing data.
